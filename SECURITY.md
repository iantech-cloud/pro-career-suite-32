# Security Configuration Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in this application and provides guidance for production deployment.

## Implemented Security Features

### ‚úÖ Client-Side Security
- **XSS Protection**: HTML content is sanitized using DOMPurify before rendering
- **Input Validation**: All forms use Zod schemas for comprehensive validation
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements enforced
- **Rate Limiting**: Client-side rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- **Secure Token Handling**: Improved token storage with expiration checks

### ‚úÖ Form Security
- **Email Validation**: Proper email format validation and sanitization
- **Password Strength**: Requirements for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Confirm Password**: Password confirmation validation
- **Input Sanitization**: User inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks

## Production Security Requirements

### üîß Backend Configuration Needed

#### 1. Security Headers
Configure these HTTP security headers on your backend:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

#### 2. CORS Configuration
Set up proper CORS headers for your domain:

```javascript
{
  origin: ['https://yourdomain.com'],
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
}
```

#### 3. Rate Limiting (Server-Side)
Implement server-side rate limiting:
- Login attempts: 5 per minute per IP
- Registration: 3 per hour per IP
- Password reset: 3 per hour per email

#### 4. Token Security
- Use httpOnly cookies for token storage
- Implement JWT with short expiration (15 minutes)
- Add refresh token mechanism
- Store tokens securely on server-side

#### 5. Input Validation
- Validate all inputs on server-side (duplicate client validation)
- Sanitize data before database storage
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

### üîê Authentication Security

#### 1. Password Security
- Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements (implemented)
- Hash passwords using bcrypt with salt rounds ‚â• 12
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts

#### 2. Session Management
- Implement proper session timeout
- Invalidate sessions on password change
- Log security events (failed logins, etc.)

### üõ°Ô∏è Database Security
- Use environment variables for database credentials
- Enable database connection encryption (SSL/TLS)
- Implement database access controls
- Regular security updates and patches

### üì± Frontend Security Checklist

#### Deployed Features ‚úÖ
- [x] XSS protection with DOMPurify
- [x] Input validation with Zod
- [x] Strong password requirements
- [x] Client-side rate limiting
- [x] Secure error handling
- [x] Form validation and sanitization

#### Still Needed for Production ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy
- [ ] Set up HTTPS enforcement
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Implement proper session management
- [ ] Add security monitoring
- [ ] Set up error reporting (without sensitive data)

### üîç Security Testing

#### Recommended Tests
1. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular security audits
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Keep dependencies updated
3. **Static Code Analysis**: Use tools like ESLint security plugins
4. **Runtime Monitoring**: Implement security event logging

#### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test XSS prevention
- [ ] Verify input validation
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Check authorization boundaries
- [ ] Validate rate limiting
- [ ] Test error handling

### üö® Security Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Monitor for security events
2. **Containment**: Have procedures to quickly disable compromised accounts
3. **Investigation**: Log security events for analysis
4. **Recovery**: Procedures for data recovery and system restoration
5. **Lessons Learned**: Regular security review meetings

### üìã Regular Security Maintenance
- [ ] Weekly dependency updates
- [ ] Monthly security reviews
- [ ] Quarterly penetration testing
- [ ] Annual security audits
- [ ] Monitor security advisories for used technologies

## Development Security Guidelines

### Code Review Checklist
- Validate all user inputs
- Check for XSS vulnerabilities
- Verify authentication/authorization
- Review error handling (no sensitive data exposure)
- Check for hardcoded secrets

### Safe Development Practices
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow principle of least privilege
